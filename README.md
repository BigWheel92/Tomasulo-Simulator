# Tomasulo-Simulator-in-C++-for-Windows

The Tomasulo-Simulator-in-C++-for-Windows simulates the tomasulo computer hardware algorithm. it shows the state after each step of execution. The code currently runs on Windows platform because it uses Window.h library.

The program requires an input file named "source.txt" which contains the information about:
 1. the number of reservation stations for add/sub, mul/div.
 2. the number of cycles of each instruction. 
 3. the total number of registers.
 4. the instructions to execute using Tomasulo Simulator.
 
 A sample input file named "source.txt" is also present in the repository.
